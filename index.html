      <p>
      Our projects are designed to widen participation, increase educational and employment opportunities for people with disabilities 
      through the use of Assistive Technology. 
      Alongside with community workers in different areas of Rwanda, 
      RATA intervenes in 4 areas which are: 
      “Raising Awareness and Advocacy on the use and importance of Assistive technology, 
      Capacity development, Inclusive education and Innovation.”

          <h2 class="title">Community Outreach and Public Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            RATA intervenes in this area as many people in Rwanda are not yet aware enough 
            of the importance of Assistive Technology in the lives of persons with disabilities.
          <span class="read_more_span none">
            It’s done through meetings, workshops, awareness campaigns and consultations among private and public institutions, schools and 
            the general community. 
            RATA also plans to use innovative and various channels to pass appropriate messages during awareness and advocacy campaigns. 
            In February 2024, Accessible free online courses on Assistive Technology were introduced on our website, to primarily make 
            sure many people in Rwanda are aware enough of the importance of Assistive Technology in the lives of persons with disabilities.

          <p>
            Public and private institutions, schools, persons with disabilities, 
            their caretakers and parents should be equipped with skills and knowledge on Assistive Technology
          <span class="read_more_span none">
            in order to widen participation, increase educational and employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. 
            The high cost of Assistive Technologies and their availability is another challenge that RATA tackles on.

          <p>
            To enhance Inclusive education, Assistive Technology plays a great role as it provides special 
            educational needs software, switches, computer access communication aids for learners with disabilities.
            <span class="read_more_span none">
              Teachers and other professionals involved in supporting children 
              with disabilities should be equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills on Assistive Technology in order to ensure that the classroom is inclusive. 
              Under the project called: “Accessible digital content for persons with disabilities”,
              RATA is training teachers in inclusive and special schools on how to prepare accessible digital content for their students.

        Assistive Technology (AT) is technology that is used by persons with disabilities to promote greater independence by enabling them to perform tasks that might otherwise be difficult or impossible.
        It can include mobility devices such as walkers and wheelchairs, as well as hardware, software, and peripherals that assist people with disabilities in accessing computers or other information technologies.

                <p>
                   Stephen Hawking is one of the most well-known physicists in the world, and he was able to achieve that in 
                   spite of being diagnosed with ALS when he was 21. He can now only speak with the assistance of a computer 
                   and has been a full-time powerchair user since the 1980s. His best-selling work, A Brief History of Time, 
                   stayed on the Sunday Times bestsellers list for an astounding 237 weeks.

                <p>
                   One of the most beloved singers alive today, Stevie Wonder is a musician, singer, and songwriter who was born blind.
                   He was born six weeks early, and his blindness was caused by a condition where the blood vessels at the back of his eyes 
                   had not yet reached the front. Despite this, Stevie has recorded more than 30 U.S. top ten hits and has had a wildly successful 
                   music career.

                <p>
                    Helen Keller was the first deaf and blind person to earn a college degree. Her story was famously portrayed in the play 
                    and film, The Miracle Worker. Despite her disabilities, she wrote 12 published books and was a member of the Socialist Party 
                    in America, campaigning heavily for women's rights and other labor rights.

              As a resource room facilitator at University of Rwanda-Nyagatare Campus,I often faced challenges while facilitating students with
              disabilities like how to make accessible documents, using braille displays, victor readers, braille embossers,...But after attending
              RATA training on Assistive Technology, I am now able to overcome such challenges.

              In 2019, I was fortunate to participate in a training on Assistive Technology conducted by RATA which inspired me to establish an
              Assistive Technology club at the University of Rwanda-HUYE Campus this year.I think this club will help students with disabilities
              at our campus who need such technologies.

              I am very grateful for the skills I gained during RATA training. As a language teacher I learnt how to make comprehension texts more
              accessible for my students by turning them into audio recordings. Additionally, I also developed skills on how to confidently create
              school materials and resources that sudents with visual impairments will find easy to use.

                I am a Geography and History teacher at HVP GATAGARA-Rwamagana. We had particular difficulties while teaching using maps and images.
                In this training, I have acquired the skills that help to deal with that. I am now confident that I can teach students without challenges.
                Also,notes used to be printed poorly without title, but due to the skills that I now possess, World documents will be published well
                and quickly converted Braille.
